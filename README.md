# Clear System Console [Blender Addon]
[DOWNLOAD HERE ON GUMROAD](https://bolwaffy.gumroad.com/l/ClearSystemConsole)  

Are you a Blender artist/developer who uses the system console for debugging?  

Then you know how quickly it can fill up with old `print()` messages and other debugging messages, making it difficult to read new information. This simple yet effective Blender addon solves that problem.  

The addon adds a button to Blender's Window dropdown menu. Clicking it instantly wipes the console clean, giving you a blank system console for debugging without the need to close and reopen Blender.
## Features

- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, potentially supporting other operating systems.
- **Lightweight:** A small, fast script that won't slow down Blender. Supported Blender Versions: 2.8+
- **Simple:** Easy to install and use. The button can be found in the _Topbar_ under **_Window_**.
